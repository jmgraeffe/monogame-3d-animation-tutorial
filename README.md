# MonoGame 3D Animation Tutorial
This repository contains a [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/) example project showing how to render animated FBX models in-game with the help of *Aether.Animation*, a library included in [tainicom's Aether.Extras](https://github.com/tainicom/Aether.Extras) project.

His project also contains samples for all of the included libraries, but here you'll find a more basic project which is ready to use without any clutter, also there is additional assistance available in the wiki on **how to embed it into existing projects** and **how to create animated models** which are compatible.

## Getting Started
Please head right to the [wiki](https://github.com/jmgraeffe/monogame-3d-animation-tutorial/wiki). Thanks!

## Credits
The pre-compiled DLL files in `Aether.Extras/` are copied from [tainicom's Aether.Extras](https://github.com/tainicom/Aether.Extras) release folder. Also, the same sample animated model is used in the example project.
